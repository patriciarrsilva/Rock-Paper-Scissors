# Rock, Paper, Scissors

In this project, Python and object-oriented programming skills were applied to build a program that plays the game of Rock Paper Scissors.

It includes computer players classes that follow various different strategies, as well as a human player class that lets a human play the game against the computer.

You can choose the number of rounds.

There are 5 different player subclasses available:

- HumanPlayer
- RockPlayer (always plays 'rock')
- RandomPlayer (chooses its moves randomly)
- ReflectPlayer (remembers and imitates what the other player did in the previous round)
- CyclePlayer (cycles through the three moves)

## Quickstart

Download the zip or clone the directory to your computer and, from inside the directory, run the game with `python rps.py` (or `python3 rps.py`)

## Change Players

The Game class accepts 2 player subclasses as arguments.

You can change these arguments to try with different players.
