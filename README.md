# Rock, Paper, Scissors

In this project, Python and object-oriented programming skills were applied to build a program that plays the game of Rock Paper Scissors.

It includes computer players classes that follow various different strategies, as well as a human player class that lets a human play the game against the computer.

The human player can choose the number of rounds.

## Quickstart

Download the zip or clone the directory to your computer and, from inside the directory, run the game with `python rps.py` (or `python3 rps.py`)
